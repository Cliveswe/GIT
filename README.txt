This reason as to why I keep this folder private is because the examples in my DOTNET folder 
contain solutions that I developed for an online University course in Android development and 
C# .Net. I took the latest the course in 2019 and the solutions in my folder are my original 
work that was submitted for grading. Thus, to prevent the temptation to plagiarise, I have 
chosen to keep this folder and its sub folders private.
Git, root folder:
The contents of this folder contain code and programming examples from C# .Net with WPF, XAML 
and Android using Java. The solutions in each of the folder show different stages of my learning 
and understanding of OOP-AD.
