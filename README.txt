Git, root folder:
The contents of this folder contain code and programming examples from C# .Net with WPF, XAML and Android applications using Java. The solutions in each of the folder show different stages of my learning and understanding of OOP-AD. In addition I have included a folder containing a web application using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript with jQuery system module.
